This is only a summary. For more information about your coverage, or to get a copy of the complete terms of coverage, call 1-866-494-2111 or visit us at www.cigna.com/ifp-documents . For general definitions of common terms, such as allowed amount, balance billing, coinsurance, copayment, deductible, provider, or other underlined terms, see the Glossary.

| Important Questions                                           | Answers                                                                                                                                       | Why This Matters:  Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this  plan begins to pay. If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must  meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all  family members meets the overall family deductible.                                                                                                       |

| Are there services  covered before you  meet your deductible? | Yes. Preventive care and other  services indicated in chart  starting on page 2.                                                              | This plan covers some items and services even if you haven't yet met the deductible amount, but  a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive  services without cost sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered  preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/.                                                                                                 |
| Are there other  deductibles for specific  services?          | No.                                                                                                                                           | You don't have to meet deductibles for specific services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| What is the out-of- pocket limit for this  plan?              | $9,200 person/ $18,400 family                                                                                                                 | The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If you have other  family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the overall  family out-of-pocket limit has been met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| What is not included in  the out-of-pocket limit?             | Premiums, balance-billing  charges, penalties for failure to  obtain preauthorization for  services and health care this  plan doesn't cover. | Even though you pay these expenses, they don't count toward the out-of-pocket limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Will you pay less if you  use a network  provider?            | Yes. See www.cigna.com/ifp- providers or call 1-866-494- 2111 for a list of network  providers.                                               | This plan uses a provider network. You will pay less if you use a provider in the plan's network.  You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network provider, and you might receive a bill from a  provider for the difference between the provider's charge and what your plan pays (balance  billing). Be aware, your network provider might use an out-of-network provider for some services  (such as lab work). Check with your provider before you get services. |
